# pinia tasks

short project on improving my pinia state management skills. I have noticed that is an area I would like to improve in.

I am adding vue router and connecting a firebase to it for authentication and basic crud operations.

## notes

`npm install pinia`
after installing pinia you must register it.

`npm install vue-router@4`
